# Giant Steps Oscillator Player

For my first project for the audio programming course at the MCT program I decided to create a player that can play John Coltrane's melody, Giant Steps, with 4 different Oscillators.

I added a marakas audio file to comp the melody as part of the exercise, just for the fun of it.
